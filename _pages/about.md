We believe in blending ecology and traditions. The property is carefully maintained to ensure it is kept as green and natural as possible. An healthy environment for guests and staff.

We respect and work with the natural elements protecting and preserving the environment around the resort.

>Wonderful Balinese Hospitality. This place is a rare find in Bali with such quality accommodation, attention to detail, delicious food with that wonderful Balinese hospitality that is owned and run by Balinese with a sustainable conscious who deeply cares about this beautiful island and its culture. Situated in a rural setting with incredible views with complete peace and quiet this is a place not to be missed. Lots of activities to choose from and close to the Besaki Temple and Lake Batur. I cannot recommend this wonderful hotel highly enough. _sunstone55, via tripadvisor_

The swimming pool uses ionization for water purification and minimizes chemicals use. The resort was designed to have cars and motorbikes are parking on the opposite side from rooms and restaurant, to preserve the peaceful atmosphere for our guests.

Our kitchen uses organic vegetables and herbs from our own garden. We are composting and improving the soil. We plant vegetables in each house garden and even grow stuff up our stone walls.

We aim to reduce energy consumption. Energy saving light bulbs are used throughout the resort (including LED). We measure and monitor energy usage, electric, fuel and gas.

>At the feet of Agung. What a find. De Klumpu is owned by local Balinese and offers a true local experience with 5 stars amenities and facilities. I enjoyed the quiet and peaceful setting. The resort offers a lot of local experiences, farming, cycling, trekking. It is also great to explore this side of Bali, not many tourists around and i can imagine what the old Bali looked like. Loved it and will return!  _alexandretsuk, via tripadvisor_


We use recycled water for watering the plants, grass and flowers limiting the use of clean water.

The resort supports the local economy and give back to the local community.
