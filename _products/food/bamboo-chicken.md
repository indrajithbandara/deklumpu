This Balinese speciality is prepared with chicken breast or leg, mixed with balinese sauce. It's arranged wrapped in Kecombrang, lemongrass and bay leaves, inside a piece of bamboo.

It's then steamed for 45 minutes. This way it takes the distinctive taste from the lemongrass and the other leaves.

It's served with rice, a soup, vegetables Plecing, and Sambal Mata, a home made mix of raw sliced shallots, onions, chillies, lemon, salt, pepper and shrimp paste with peanuts.
